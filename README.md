# Benchmarks

## Introduction

One of my friends told me at least three times that Java is the greatest computer language currently. It is fast and safe. He cares about the performance of the languages very much. I think the speed of a language is indeed nonnegligible. I try to learn a new language that is fast enough and has a user-friendly grammar.

## primes

```python
def primes(n):
    # sieve of Eratosthenes
    
    f = np.zeros(n+1)
    f[0::2] = 1
    i = 3
    nn = np.sqrt(n)
    while i <= nn:
        if f[i] == 0:
            j = i*i
            while j <= n:
                f[j] = 1
                j += i * 2  #i.e. j=i(i+2) not j += i, since 2|i(i+1)
        i += 2
    P = [2]
    for x in range(3, n+1, 2):
        if f[x] == 0:
            P.append(x)
    # P = [2] + [x for x in range(3, n+1, 2) if f[x] == 0]
 
    return P
```



### Results(/s)

| Python(numba) | Ruby  | Lua   | Julia | Java | Haskell | go |
| ------------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ---- | ------- |----|
| 3.9(~0.88)    | ~1.92 | ~2.77 | 0.25  | ?    | ?       | 189.883Âµs|



To my surprise, Ruby is faster than Python! :astonished: Julia is really fucking rapid, even faster than Python with numba. I tried my best to implement the algorithm in Java, but failed :cry:. I do not think I would learn Java currently, or C-family, their grammar is overstaffed and not user-friendly. I also do not master Haskell but I would persist in learning it. The grammar of Julia is similar to Matlab, but with much new concept that scare me.

I implemented the algorithm with Go, it perfume unbelievable well! I was moved by Go, though its grammar is also a little wired for me.
